Documentation of the Main.java program
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The program is a Quiz Application/Program in Java
I've created a nested class that represents a question in quiz. It contains;
'String text' : The text of the question
'List<String> choices' : A list of possible answer choices.
'int correctChoiceIndex' : The index of correct choices in the list of choices.

Quiz: 
A nested static class that represents a quiz. It contains: 
'String name' : The name of the quiz.
'List<Question> questions' : A list of questions in the quiz.

I have used the data structure array<list> in java to store the questions and answers for a quiz.

I have explained the major and important classes in the application below: 

The class SimpleQuizApp is the main class of the application. It contains the main method and logic to handle user queries.
The Quiz Class: It represents the quiz with a name and list of questions. 
Main List and Scanner: Initializes the list of quizzes and scanner for user input.
Main Method: Starts the application.
